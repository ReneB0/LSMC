## Project title
Pricing Convertible Bonds with Least-Squared Monte Carlo (LSMC) model 
 
 
## Project description
 
The aim of this work is to provide a clear Python based code for modelling Convertible Bonds based on the LSMC framework. With the correct pricing of these instruments, one can identify, avoid, limit or even explore arbitrage opportunities. 
 
I chose Python for its simplicity and readability in regards to quantitative and qualititve analyis of asset prices and predictions. 
 
Some of the challenges and limitations of my project are described in more detail in the code.
 
 
 
## How to install and run the project
 
My code uses the following Python modules and they should be installed on your machine before running the code:
 
-NumPy  
-math  
-scipy.stats  
-PyLab  
 
## How to use the project
 
Convertible Bonds can come with several distinct features such as put, calls, duration, coupon etc. and market assumptions for the risk free rate and stock volatility which can be adjusted. In addition, I added the possibility of stock jumps in the model with the possibility do define size and frequency of the jump. With these input assumptions, the code will model the fair value of instrument.

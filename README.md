# The aim of this work is to provide a clear Python based code with the proposed pricing framework for modelling Convertible Bonds (CBs). With the correct pricing of these instruments at hand, one can identify, avoid, limit or even explore arbitrage opportunities. I will not go into much detail as to how a Convertible Bond works, and thus, I assume the reader has already a good understanding on the mechanics behind a CBs.

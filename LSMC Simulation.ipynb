    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Convertible Bonds (CBs) are hybrid instruments that simultaneously offer the potential upside participation of equities, while providing a limited downside in the form of a bond floor. This work aims at presenting how one may properly model a well-known market product, a path-dependent Puttable American CB. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the underlying equity path, a stock price-based model is chosen such that the stock price (S) is stochastic and deterministic. This is done by maintaining the main input factors constant, namely, interest rate and stock volatility. Additionally, the Market is assumed to be complete and the stock time-series to follow a Geometric Brownian Motion. An enhancement to the latter is introduced in the form of a more realistic non-lognormal distribution for equity, by simulating random drawdowns representing market crashes, the consequence being a skewed and leptokurtic return distribution. For this, a jump-diffusion process with predefined probability and magnitude of the jumps is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, modelling CBs with the possibility of early conversion (American Call style option) and alongside an option to Put the CB (European style option) at a predefined date in the future, a least-squared Monte Carlo (LSMC) method with backward induction technique is used.  In the modelling herewith presented, CB’s credit risk is assumed to be constant and independent from stock movement, for simplification.\n",

    "## Goals and Structure of the work\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this work is to provide a clear Python based code with the proposed pricing framework for modelling Convertible Bonds. With the correct pricing of these instruments at hand, one can identify, avoid, limit or even explore arbitrage opportunities. I will not go into much detail as to how a Convertible Bond works, and thus, I assume the reader has already a good understanding on the mechanics behind a CB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work is divided into following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I will first calculate the CB’s Bond-Floor in a matrix for each day of the life of the CB, with a Put option at a predefined date that gives the holder the right to redeem the Bond at a predefined price. The Bond-Floor is subject to the Risk Free Rate, the Credit Risk Spread and the Put Price/Redemption Price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I then will simulate possible stock paths of the CB’s underlying equity in a random number matrix by using Monte Carlo methods that follows the Geometric Brownian Motion with jumps to the downside to reflect a more realistic stock path that results in a non-lognormal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To price the CB a backward induction technique called Least-squared Monte Carlo is used\n",
    "\n",
    "- To benchmark the result, I use a classical Black-Scholes pricing model used for European options\n",
    "\n",
    "- A sensitivity analysis is shown on how the model behaves with various input assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lastly, I will summarize, make a conclusion and discuss the limitation of this work\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I seed the random number generator in order to be able to discuss the model's output in this work."

    "In this work, I have presented a concept to model and price a Convertible Bond with American Call and European Put features. I believe I have successfully demonstrated how to use the LSMC, a method to cope with these features. With the help of a traditional Black-Scholes model for the Stock Call option, and a Black-76 model for the Bond Put option, I was able to estimate the synthetically replicate these features, and hence to benchmark the CB's theoretical value derived from the LSMC model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this work, I have assumed a constant credit risk. However, variations in credit risk do indeed impact the Convertible Bond price. Thus, a very natural extension one shall consider is to include a credit risk profile over the life of the CB. Similar, as I have assumed a fixed interest rate level, extending the provided pricing framework to a setting where the interest rate follows a given term structure might be advisable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of this work is the model's sensibility to stock volatility. The model  uses a constant and deterministic stock volatility. In real world, future stock movements are not a predefined parameter, but rather retrieved from market data. This volatility effect poses a serious limitation for general use of LSMC methods to price Convertible Bonds. A possible extension to the presented pricing framework could be to consider a model where the volatility is not constant and deterministic but stochastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, to price a bond put option is not as straight forward as I have hoped it is, as it requires assumptions about interest rate volatility. This in itself could already be an academic paper which is out of scope for the purpose of this work, and thus I have used rather naïve assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the value derived from the benchmarking has some flaws when compared to a true convertible bond. For example, the options embedded in a convertible bond are not detachable from the bond. Instead, the debt is converted into equity upon conversion, and at some point there is no debt, but just more shares. Another limitation is that call options typically require investors to make an additional payment within a specified time frame in order to exercise it and receive stock in exchange. Funds can be obtained by selling the straight bond, but the value is not certain and additional funds may be required at extra cost. "
